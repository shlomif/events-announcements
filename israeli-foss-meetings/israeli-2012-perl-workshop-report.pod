=head1 Shlomi Fish’s Report about the 2012 Israeli Perl Workshop

This is my report about the 
L<Israeli Perl Workshop of 2012|http://act.perl.org.il/ilpw2012/> . It was
a fun and educational event, and I'm glad I was able to attend it. For better
or for worse, all the talks I attended were in Room 1, but I was still able
to hear the ends of a few talks in Room 2 (because the corresponding talks
in Room 1 ended before them).

I set up an alarm the night before in order to wake up early in time for the
event, and ended up waking up some time before it (and even the alarm time was
much earlier than what I was used to). Then I made some preparations, ate
breakfast, and caught the appropriate bus. After I walked from the bus station
to Shenkar, it took me some time to find the place, because it wasn't the
same entrance as our normal rooms, and the signs were confusing. What I needed
to do was to take the stairs down to the yard, and then go to the organisation
room, but it was hard to find.

There I got my sticker, the schedule, and some swag from booking.com.

In the yard, I met a few people including 
L<Florian Ragwitz|http://search.cpan.org/~flora/> (a.k.a "FLORA" on CPAN or
"rafl" on IRC - he has many cool modules there, including quite a few XS ones),
who was one of the workshop’s visitors from Germany. Despite being German, his
English accent sounded English to us. Later on we discussed accents in English 
and he noted that the accents of some Israelis he met sounded like French to 
him (while ours seemed less so). This is strange, because Israelis can
distinguish between a French accent in English and an Israeli Hebrew accent in
English. 


=head2 TODO: Add these:

* Amir telling about how and why he translated the Twitter interface to
Hebrew.
* Meeting FLORA/RAFL/Florian Ragwitz.
** He told me that he is going to review and pull my Test::Aggregate
pull request.
** He is German, but he has an English-sounding accent.
*** The English Accent of some Israelis sounding like French (ours seem less
so).
**** We can distinguish between French accent in English and Israeli Hebrew 
accent in English and in Hebrew.
* All the talks I wanted to hear were in room 1 (while sometimes visiting Room 
2 to hear the ends of talks).
* Talk with Amir and Meir about English knowledge vs. translation in non-Hebrew
speaking countries.
** Dutch people know English well, but tend to use Dutch localisation on their
computers.
** Whether you can translate many documents for all Spanish speakers or
teach all Spanish speakers English.
*** Giving fish vs. teaching how to fish.
*** Meir said he once worked with Spanish Electrical Engineers with poor
English and he said they were isolated from the rest of the industry due to
poor English.
* Food was interesting, and sometimes tasty.
** The "Cheese Cake without Cheese"/etc.
* Sawyer's talk about creating a sample CPAN distribution
** https://metacpan.org/module/CPAN::Changes
** Covered Dist-Zilla , Module-Install, module-starter and what every file
does.
* I did not stay for the post-workshop restaurant-going because I was too
tired.
** I found someone to give me a ride back home and we ended up struggling with
the GPS.
* The talk about Template::Flute ( https://metacpan.org/module/Template::Flute
).
** Seems like an interesting and useful concept.
** Less developer friendly than Template-Toolkit/etc.
** Someone asked me that he thought that having a separate XML SPEC file in
addition to the HTML template, was indicative of a problem with the module
or its approach, but I cannot think of any way to avoid it, given the 
limitations of HTML/XHTML.
* Ran's talk about game programming in Perl/SDL and Tweens.
* Ran's Syntactic Sugar talk:
** Had to be trimmed towards the end - the introduction took too long.
** Hopefully Ran can give a rerun on one of the mongers' meeting with more time.
* The Time Management talk was cancelled and we had a 20 minute break (due
to time mismanagement? ;-))
* The Zero to CPAN talk was eventually given by Sawyer instead of Erez Schatz.
** Very nice one, and I've learned about CPAN::Changes (from Florian, though).
* The configuration management talk.
** Gitflow.
** Something else I forgot its name for change/task/project management.
** I asked about integrated solutions (from IBM/etc.) - cost a lot and no
experience with them.
* Sawyer's CGI.pm Must Die talk.
** He said he needed to become energised because the delivery was going to
be emotional.
** The ancedote from the other conference (FOSDEM ?).
** The talk was indeed emotional (though the chat with him before hand 
beforehand kinda made me expect more), but still informative and convincing.
** Dotan's rebuttal of "CGI.pm - the only web-development framework you'll ever
need" was less convincing, but still had a few good points.
*** I'm not convinced that CGI.pm's HTML-generation routines are the last word
in templating system.
* Ynon Perek's "Implementing Perl (Moose) Design Pattern)
** Again, not everything fit inside the time frame.
** Inheritance vs. Roles vs. Containment/delegation and why Inheritance is
bad.
** I was surprised at the implementation of the Factory pattern, and don't
remember the implementation given by Ynon.
* Tamir Lousky - Generating vector graphics with Perl and SVG.
** Very nice eye candy in the slides.
** The introduction to SVG and generating it was quite rudimentary.
** The demonstration and explanation of the tree generation module was
interesting.
* David Tabchnikov - Scaling Up:
** Interesting talk.
** Optimisation vs. Vertical Scaling (buying faster machines) vs. Horizontal
Scaling (buying more machines and distributing them).
** He said there's some speed difference between the various SQL databases,
but he didn't encounter a situation where it would have made much difference.
* Lightning talks:
** Florian Ragwitz about Google Code-In and Google Summer-of-Code.
** ׂGabor Szabo about surviving in an uncooperative workplace.
*** A new middle manager who told him: “I don’t belive in automated testing.”.
*** Create your own Island of sanity.
