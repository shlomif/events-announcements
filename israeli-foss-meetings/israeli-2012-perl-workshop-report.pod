=head1 Shlomi Fishâ€™s Report about the 2012 Israeli Perl Workshop

=head2 TODO: Add these:

* Meeting FLORA/RAFL/Florian Ragwitz.
** He told me that he is going to review and pull my Test::Aggregate
pull request.
** He is German, but he has an English-sounding accent.
*** The English Accent of some Israelis sounding like French (ours seem less
so).
**** We can distinguish between French accent in English and Israeli Hebrew 
accent in English and in Hebrew.
* All the talks I wanted to hear were in room 1 (while sometimes visiting Room 
2 to hear the ends of talks).
* Food was interesting, and sometimes tasty.
** The "Cheese Cake without Cheese"/etc.
* Sawyer's talk about creating a sample CPAN distribution
** https://metacpan.org/module/CPAN::Changes
** Covered Dist-Zilla , Module-Install, module-starter and what every file
does.
* I did not stay for the post-workshop restaurant-going because I was too
tired.
** I found someone to give me a ride back home and we ended up struggling with
the GPS.
